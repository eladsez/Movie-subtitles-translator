-[man] You want cheese?
-Sure.

7
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,045
Lettuce, tomato?

8
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:42,265
Uh, let me get some
lettuce, tomato,

9
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:43,832
and let me get
some of those peppers.

10
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,225
[mouthing]

11
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:46,313
Done.

12
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:50,795
Yo, are you high?

13
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:53,494
I said peppers,
not cucumbers.

14
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:57,715
Sorry, sir, my bad.

15
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:00,283
Mayo, mustard?

16
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:02,067
Uh, mayo, and, uh,

17
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,678
give me some of that
salt and pepper, buddy.

20
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:11,990
Hi, Dorith.
This is Jackson Briggs.

21
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:13,340
I was just checking
on my status

22
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:14,906
for the Pakistan rotation.

23
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,300
Um, just trying
to sort my travel.

24
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:19,520
Mr. Briggs, you know the
agency can't send a soldier

25
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,826
with a history of brain
injuries to a war zone.

26
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,481
No, no, I just got you guys
a full, clean medical.

27
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:26,091
Yes, but we need

28
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:28,442
your commanding officer
to certify that.

29
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,444
Yeah, and I've told
the recruiter, like, 12 times.

30
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:31,923
You know these guys.

31
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,316
They're impossible
to reach on deployment.

32
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,709
But it's coming.
So let's just get

33
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:36,232
the on-boarding process going

34
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,800
and, I don't know,
get my travel sorted.

35
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:41,759
Mr. Briggs,
you know we can't do that.

36
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,109
Look, I got other agencies
beating down my door,

37
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:45,110
so, look...

38
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:50,420
So, look, I can't wait till
next year's rotation, okay?

39
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:52,335
And we can't staff you
without that recommendation.

40
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:57,297
Okay, uh, when do I need
to have it by?

41
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,603
The rotation closes
next Wednesday.

42
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,084
All right,
you'll hear from me.

43
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:26,326

46
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:50,480
-Hello.
-Briggs, this is Jones.

47
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,264
Hey, Captain.

48
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:53,614
Are you in the middle
of something?

49
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:55,442
No, no, it's a good time.

50
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:56,791
Yeah, no, I was calling about

51
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,358
that diplomatic
security application

52
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,881
I was hoping you'd
help me with.

53
00:05:59,924 --> 00:06:01,535
Look, I'm calling
about Rodriguez.

54
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:03,101
He passed away last night.

55
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:04,276
Stop me
if you already heard this.

56
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:06,148
No.

57
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:09,804
No, I didn't hear.

58
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:11,458
I'm sorry, Briggs.

59
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:12,763
We're all going
to Patton Barracks

60
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:13,764
to say goodbye to him.

61
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:16,985
-When?
-Tomorrow night.

62
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:19,944
All right.

63
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,774
-Briggs?
-Yeah, I'll be there.

[man] Sergeant Rodriguez
was a legend

67
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:53,630
who never quit.

68
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,853
He burned bright
and then he burned in.

00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:02,465
Airborne Ranger in the sky.

70
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,380
[all] Airborne Ranger
in the sky.

71
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,034
You can tell an Airborne
Ranger by his boots!

[sighs]

77
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,236
Just need you to call
and just be like, "He's good."

78
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,933
-No.
-That's it.

79
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:37,457
-I'm trying to get some money.
-It's not happening.

80
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,806
I'm trying to get
some money, that's it.

81
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,372
-Not happening.
-[Briggs] 200K a year,

-that's all I want.
-[overlapping chatter]

83
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,767
Just, like,
make the call for me.

84
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:45,073
Yeah, I wish I had that power,

85
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:46,944
but your boy's
still an E-6, so...

86
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:48,729
-[laughs]
-...that's not happening.

87
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:50,295
I love him.
You shut your mouth.

88
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,775
You shut your mouth
when you talk about him.

-[somber music playing]
-[chatter continues]

90
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:15,799

[all] Taboo! Taboo!

92
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,892
Get up, Kiernan. Come on.

93
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:23,415
-Oh, no.
-You're pissing me off.

94
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,156
-Let's go.
-Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

95
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,680
-Up, up.
-Hey, hey, figure it out.

96
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:27,898
Figure it out.

97
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:31,119
Okay, Briggs, get on with it.

98
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,731
-What?
-You know what.

99
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:36,385
Hey, you're the one who's
[chuckles]

100
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,256
screening my calls
and ghosting my texts, sir.

101
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,388
Like, what's a girl
supposed to think?

102
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:41,129
He's supposed to get the hint.

103
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:42,696
"Hi, it's Captain Jones

104
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,567

of Staff Sergeant Briggs.

105

He's a total badass,

106
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,439
he's squared away,
good to go."

107
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:48,919
You made that call
for 50 other soldiers.

108
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:50,268
Yeah, who haven't been flagged
for TBIs.

109
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:51,400
Take it up with the doctors,
not me.

110
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:52,575
Look, Bear's got half a hand.

111
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:54,142
You got a, like a chunk

112
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:55,578
of shrapnel stuck
in your tramp stamp.

113
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:57,275
Kiernan can barely remember
his name.

114
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,973
-Shut your mouth.
-There's a hundred concussions

this entire parking lot.

-[Jones grunts]
-And it's not stopping y'all.

In, in.

[sighs] Ours aren't on paper.

119
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:10,201
Maybe check your email.
I got a full, clean medical.

120
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:11,463
Yeah? How much
you pay for that?

121
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:13,074
That's not the point.

122
00:09:13,117 --> 00:09:14,641
Sir, name it,
what do you want?

123
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:15,990
Tell me what you want.

124
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:20,168
[sighs] I'm sorry,
get home safe.

125
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:21,256
[Briggs] You're just gonna
get in... Okay.

126
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,649
You want me to get the...

127
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:23,824
All right, I'm getting
the knee pads.

128
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:25,347
[engine starting]

129
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,957
I'm getting the knee pads,
sir. Come on.

130
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,306
Are you really just gonna
pull out right now?

131
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,743
Might as well
just get the strap

132
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,092
out of the center console
and put me down

133
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,441
if I can't get back
in the game,

134
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:33,921
just go ahead
and end it for me.

135
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,487
Just put me out of my misery,
it's fine.

136
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:36,880
[Jones] Briggs, get home safe.
That's an order.

137
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:39,448
Sir, where are you goin'? Sir!

138
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:41,406
Sir!

[car door opens]

140
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,467

[grunts]

142
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,297

is a total badass, huh?

[laughing]

144
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,256
Oh, hey, Captain.

145
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,910
Figured I'd find you
still here.

146
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:08,346
Get yourself together.

147
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,521
Come meet me
in Battalion in 30.

148
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,524
Does that mean
you're gonna make the call?

149
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:16,050
Hey, Captain, all the guys
talk shit about you,

150
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:17,486
but I always knew
you had a heart of gold,

151
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,009
and I was like,
"Not my captain.

152
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:20,837
No."

I've been in and out

Okay, think about it.
What's the odds I'm ISIS?

Step out of the vehicle, sir.

162

You want me to step out
of the vehicle...

-Hey.
-...I'll happily...

00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:26,598
[officer] Surrender
is not a Ranger word.

177
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:28,513
[soldiers repeating]

178
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,211
[officer] I'll never leave
a fallen comrade...

179
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:31,778
What? Y'all gave away
my parking spot.

180
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,518
I had to walk all the way
from the DFAC.

181
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:35,085
-Keep pushing.
-Where are y'all headed?

182
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,479
We're wheels down in Syria
in 24 hours.

183
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,437
C-17 is loading up
as we speak.

184
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,004
[Briggs] Look, sir,
I really appreciate this,

185
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:42,484
I ain't gonna let you down.

186
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:43,790
I've been working
the last three years

187
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:44,878
to get it straight
for this job.

188
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:46,357
That's what I like to hear.

189
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:47,794
Kennelo, what did I say about

190
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:49,534
using your mom's weights?
Like...

191
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:50,884
I'm trying to look good
for your mom.

192
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,581
Well, I'm just trying
to say, just...

193
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:53,930
I don't know, more quads.

194
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:55,323
Gonna give you a baby brother.

195
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:58,761
So what do you gotta do?
Interview me or something

196
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,937
to make sure I've got
a brain cell left, or...

197
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:02,722
Yeah, something like that.

198
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,724
[chuckling] Well, you say,
"Jump," I say, "How high?"

199
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,378
Wait, isn't your office
this way?

200
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:08,553
[Jones] Sure is.

201
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:13,776
Riley's stuff
just about ready, Kiernan?

202
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,212
Just about, sir.

203
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:17,214
You good, man?

204
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,261
[sighs] Yeah, man.
It is what it is.

205
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,002
[Briggs] Yeah.

206
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,570
Riley was about as solid
as they come.

207
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:27,485
Tell that to the tree
he hit doin' 120.

208
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,618
[Jones] All right, Kiernan,
let's go, come on.

209
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:33,404
[Briggs] What's gonna
happen to his dog?

210
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:35,189
Thought you'd never ask.

211
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:37,017
Family funeral's Sunday
outside of Nogales.

212
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:40,281
She's the guest of honor.

213
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:42,457
Oh, that's...
That's a genius idea.

214
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,285
I hope she doesn't
eat everybody first.

215
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:46,766
[chuckles softly]
Well, that part will be
up to you.

216
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:51,161
Wait, wait, what?

217
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:53,381
-[dogs barking]
-[man shouting indistinctly]

218
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:57,080
[Jones] We sent Riley's body
off late last night.

219
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:59,779
And his mother called this
morning. She wants his hero dog
at the funeral.

220
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:02,085
Sir, are you asking me to fly
a damn dog to Arizona?

221
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:04,174
No, I'm asking you
to drive a Ranger to Arizona.

222
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:05,480
She refuses to fly.

223
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:08,091
Why ain't she deploying
with you?

224
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:10,311
Won't work with anyone. One
minute she's good, the next
minute, she's sending three guys
to the ER.

225
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:14,097
Riley kept trying
after you guys got blown up,
but she's gone all the way.

226
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:17,057
Maybe Riley should have thought
of that before he broke the
speed of sound into a tree.

227
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,581
- Yeah, well,
Rangers find a way to die.
- Hold on,
let me get this straight,

228
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:21,844
so I agree to do this,
and you're gonna call
Black Canopy

229
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:25,152
-and get my packet pushed.
-You do this, and then I make
the call, no screw-ups,

230
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:28,242
nothing gets back to me. After
the service, you drop off on
base down at White Sands,

231
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:29,765
they'll handle the rest.

232
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,419
White Sands? So they're just
gonna put her down anyway.

233
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:33,856
There's not a handler or a PD
crazy enough to adopt her up.

234
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,467
Doesn't make us feel warm
and fuzzy inside.
Just is what it is.

235
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:40,558
How about I disappear her ass,
you make the call, and we both
go on with our lives? How about
that?

236
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:43,518
You stick your neck out for
Battalion, I'll stick mine out
for you.

237
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,259
-Take it or leave it.
-Sir...

238
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,437
Ready to pick up
your furry flash-bang?

239
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,699
[Briggs]
That's what I'm told, man.

240
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,614
[Jones]
Here's the deal, Briggs,

241
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:54,659
this isn't the same dog
you served with,

242
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:57,010
she's got every combat trigger
in the book.

243
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,663
So you keep her secured

244
00:13:58,707 --> 00:13:59,926
and you don't take her out
in public.

245
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:03,668
We clear?

246
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,717
All right.

247
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,111
If anyone asks, say she's
on her way to rehabilitation.

248
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,680
Hey, do you want me
to leash her up for you?

249
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,204
No, let's just
get this over with.

250
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:18,248
All right.

251
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:23,645
What's up, dog?

252
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:26,474
You remember me?

253
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,519
[growls softly]

254
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,478
Your favorite chew toy
from 2015.

255
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:35,091
Huh?

256
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:36,701
Me and you are gonna go
on a little road trip.

257
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:37,877
[dog panting]

258
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,791
[Briggs] Fifteen hundred miles.

259
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:42,316
Just to act like your daddy's
looking down on us from above.

260
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,319
All right, I'm gonna
leash you up.

261
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,973
All right?

262
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,411
Be cool. Easy.

263
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:52,543
Easy.

264
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,637
You really did give up, huh?

265
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:01,901
What are y'all so scared of?
She's milding out big-time.

266
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,294
-[groans]
-[laughter]

267
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,382
[Briggs] Stop!

268
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:08,472
Enough!

269
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:10,126
Hey, man, I forgot to
tell you not to touch her
on the ears, man.

270
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,519
I left that part out.

271
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,956
[barking and whining]

272
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,523
[man] Hey, we weaned
her off the Prozac,

273
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,307
so she might get moody
from time to time.

274
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:19,005
Her muzzle can only stay on

275
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,832
for about two hours at a time
or she'll overheat.

276
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:22,530
Make sure you put water
in her food,

277
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,140
and as you know,
don't touch her ears.

278
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:25,533
Other than that,
here's your Bible.

279
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:26,926
-Have a good trip.
-See you, Trent.

280
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:29,711
[barking]

281
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,452
Thank you, sir.

282
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,714
All the belongings in
Sergeant Rodriguez's backpack

283
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,063
go to his family.

284
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:35,673
They want his uniform
at the funeral.

285
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:37,153
The "I Love Me" book,
that stays with Lulu.

286
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:39,808
If you have any trouble,
all her info's in there.

287
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:41,331
I'm not gonna be out there
long enough.

288
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,204
-Hey.
-Rangers lead the way, sir.

289
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:45,335
-All the way.
-[Lulu barking]

290
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,603
-[man 1] Good luck.
-[Briggs] All right, boys.

291
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:53,996
[man 2] Looks like Briggs
finally got a girl.

292
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,435
["Run It" playing]

293
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,853
-[line ringing]
-This is Dorith.

294
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,637
Hey, Dorith,
this is Jackson Briggs again.

295
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:27,899
I was just calling
to let you guys know

296
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:29,510
that I only fly business class

297
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:31,642
to countries with names
that end in "stan."

298
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:33,427
Sir, we're still missing
your recommendation.

299
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,168
Uh, look, it's actually
what I was callin' about.

300
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:36,299
-[whining]
-So, first thing

301
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:37,909
Monday morning, uh,

302
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,476
you'll be getting a call
from Captain Luke Jones

303
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,261
from Second Ranger Battalion.

304
00:16:41,304 --> 00:16:43,045
If we hear from your captain
before Wednesday,

305
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:44,829
I'll let the RSO know

306
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:46,614
-to expect you on rotation.
-[whining and barking]

307
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:48,311
Yes, ma'am, I'm very, very
happy to be working with...

308
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:50,052
-[continues barking]
-Yes, sir, I can't hear you...

309
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:52,054
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am,
thank you so much. I... Okay.

310
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:53,273
[Lulu barking]

311
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:54,317
[Briggs] What?

312
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:58,060
[frustratedly]
What is your deal, man?

313
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:00,497
-Come on.
-[whines]

314
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,325
You're just slobbering
all over my seat.

315
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:05,067
[barking and whining]

316
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,851
Maybe just take
the crazy down.

317
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,984
-Just like one notch.
-[Lulu whining]

318
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,813
Just one notch, that's it,
and maybe we could get along.

319
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:13,597
-[whines]
-And if we get along,

320
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,295
maybe we could
even have some fun

321
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:16,905
and send Riley off right.

322
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:18,559
-[whining]
-Doesn't that sound nice, dog?

323
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:23,477
I'm all you got, I'm it.

324
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,827
-It's just me.
-[whining]

325
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:28,308
Believe it or not,
I don't wanna

326
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,614
keep you all muzzled up 24/7.

327
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:32,355
I really don't.

328
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:34,662
And to be honest,
I don't wanna drive

329
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,968
straight to some
dry-ass desert town

330
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:40,320
and just sit in a motel
and stare at a wall for five
days waiting for his funeral.

331
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:42,061
-[barks]
-Do you?

332
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:47,501
[barking]
Come on, man. Okay,
okay, fine, fine, fine, fine.

333
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:50,243
All right. So I gotta
take your muzzle off,

334
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:52,071
but if you bite me,

335
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,724
I'm gonna leave it on
all the way to Arizona.

336
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:55,987
-[Lulu growling]
-So be chill,

337
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:58,120
-all right? That's great.
-[growling stops]

338
00:17:58,164 --> 00:17:59,861
-[starts growling]
-Just remember all those times

339
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:02,951
we had fun kicking in doors,

Easy. Do not bite me
in the face, all right?

342
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,134
I'm gonna reach up,

343
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:14,745
I'm not gonna touch your ears,
or near your ears.

-All right,
I'm not touchin' that,
I'm not touchin' that.

345
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:20,273
All right, all right. We're
good, we're good. Okay, look at
that. We did it, we did it.

346
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:21,448
We did it.

Stop it. Hey, hey, chill out.

350
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:30,544
Fine, fine.
Stay in there then.

351
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:33,155
Stay in there, have fun.

No! [frustratedly]
Oh, my God!

You just stay right there!

369
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,232
You know, I was
gonna let you have

370
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:51,625
a little bit of fun
on this trip.

371
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:54,018
I was gonna let you
run and frolic,

00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:56,673
you know, sniff some buttholes
and all that, but no,

373
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:58,545
turns out they are right,
you're just a demon.

-All right,

No?

378
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:07,423
All right, fine.

Oh, what's happening?

382
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:51,946
You're gettin' a little sleepy
back there?

Someone gettin'
a little tired, tired?

Oh, allergy season
is brutal this year.

Man, you used to be a legend.
Not no more, huh?

Wait, what'd you say?

Oh! Daddy should go out
and get some beers,
you're right.

Let you get a little shut-eye.
Okay, I'll do that.

390

That's really nice of you.
You're right, too,

but that's not the point.

Still sad,

-[woman] Maker's.
-[Briggs] Maker's.

Can we get two more
of those, please?

401
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:36,251
You want me to tease it,
or add to it?

402
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,470
Please don't tease it,
just Maker's in a glass.

-Awesome.

We just do our jobs.

I mean, you don't have to
wait in this line, you know?

You just pop on that
VR headset, and boom,

409
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,786
you're at the illest bar
on Earth,

410
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,353
hanging with guys like me.

411
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:53,573
How do you get to
the actual beers, though?

412
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:56,358
Virtual beers, bro.
That's the beauty of it.

for me to get behind the

00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:09,937
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was saying. Yeah.

419
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,373
So at what point
did you realize

420
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,114
that you were just a pawn
for big oil?

421
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:14,420

All these big oil fat cats,

425
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:21,122
they think that
they own this place.

426
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:22,384
They think they own
Mother Earth,

427
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:23,907
but no one owns Mother Earth,

428
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:25,387
and I'm gonna fight
against them every day

429
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,693

you get half off.

to come right back?

Tonight, I said to myself,
you're gonna love this,

443

I said, "You will meet
a construction worker

444
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:53,763
or a soldier."

445
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:56,287
-That's interesting.
-Or, I don't know,

446
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:59,856
any man without
a white savior complex.

447
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:01,815
Good luck.

00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:04,383
Wait, what?

449
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,297
I hope that you get
the help that you need.

00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:08,169
-Thanks for the drink.
-No, no. Look, look,

by the Taliban.

We gotta get outta here

because you are about the
only woman in this entire city

have a conversation with.

with you. Here.

Look, I didn't want
to drug you.

459
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:32,759
You didn't have to eat my
seats, that's all I'm saying.

460
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:35,414
We can be friends, but this is
gonna be an eye for an eye.

-No, um, no, no.

Actually she's, um,
she's a little sad right now.

She's... She's, um, grieving.

She lost her best friend.

[woman 1] Oh, no, sweetheart.

477
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:11,450
I know. Who are...
Who are these little cuties?

478
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,626
-Oh, this is Lucy.
-This is Maggie.

479

Aw, they're so cute.

-[woman 1] They're Shih Tzus.
-They're great.

Oh, I love Shih Tzus.

-Here you go.
-Thank you.

Mmm-hmm. Cheers.

this city before I met y'all.

for everybody.

it's growin' on me.

-Okay.
-Yeah.

491
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:40,783
We DJ ecstatic dance circles
sometimes, though.

492
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:42,568
That's sick. Is that, like...
That's like yoga?

493
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:45,701
I've done yoga.
But I'm horrible at it.

494
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:48,095
We help heal people
by moving blocked energy

495
00:24:48,138 --> 00:24:49,531
so they can experience

496

the full potential
of sexual pleasure.

497
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:55,668
Oh.

498
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,367
So you just move
the energy for...

499
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,977
Hell, yeah. I can...

500
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:02,936
I mean, I got... I got cash
in the truck, I think.

501
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:04,415
[chuckles] Oh, no, no.

502
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,942
No, the attraction
is completely genuine.

503
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:11,727
Ah. I mean...

504
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:13,120
As long as
it's in the flow for you.

505
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:16,384
No, I'm good.

506
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:17,690
-Kidding.

Hey, what did you
hit me with, man?
Horse tranq?

681
00:34:05,652 --> 00:34:07,088
This is pretty good.

682
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:08,220
[man] Time for you
to start squealing.

683
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:10,918
Hey, have you seen a dog?

684
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:13,094
She's brown, she's, like,
running around,

685
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:15,314
I don't know,
with crazy eyes, huh?

686
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:18,360
[man] Tell me who you work for.

687
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:20,014
[Briggs] Okay, look,

688
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,886
[sighs] I'm obviously not
who you think I am.

689
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,540
[man] I know
who the hell you are.

690
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,893
Think you're the first
commando they sent up here?

691
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:30,851
Take my strains?

692
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:35,899
Look, old man, unless
you're willing to walk this

693
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:37,075
till the end of the road,

694
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,554
I highly suggest
you cut me loose

695
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:40,165
and let me go find
my damn dog.

696
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:42,123
[man] You got five minutes
to clear your head,

697
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,081
or you can join her ass.

698
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:45,692
[grunts and groans]

699
00:34:46,823 --> 00:34:48,608
[breathing heavily]

700
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:57,704
[grunting]

701
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:03,579
[groans and pants]

702
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:15,287
-[zip tie snaps]
-[grunts]

703
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:22,032
[pig grunting]

704
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:25,340
[clatters]

705
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:37,526
Hell, yeah.

706
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:52,150
[man speaking indistinctly]

707
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,934
Who the hell you think
you're talking to?

708
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:56,763
We'll see about that.

709
00:35:58,591 --> 00:35:59,592
Bitch!

710
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:04,771
[operatic music playing softly
on speakers]

711
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:34,888
[man mumbling indistinctly]

712
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:40,850
Oh, that is...
That's bullshit.

713
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,418
[man speaking indistinctly]

714
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:46,116
[softly] Dog, come here,
come here.

715
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,683
-[Lulu panting]
-[whispers] Now! Come here!

716
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:49,207
Come here!

717
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,038
[woman] Gus, is he awake yet?

718
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:56,649
[Gus] Wide awake.
He's zip-tied in the barn.

719
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:58,085
[woman] Zip-tied? Oh, my God.

720
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:59,869
What the hell
did you do to him?

721
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:02,045
[Gus] Some shit.
I told him I killed his dog.

722
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:03,830
[woman] Gus, what do you know
about interrogation?

723
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:05,484
You were
a conscientious objector.

724
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:07,312
[Gus] How about a little
damn appreciation?

725
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:10,097
[woman] I told you not to hit
those edibles so hard.

726
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,273
Cartel? You paranoid maniac.

727
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:13,796
-Tell him you're...
-[Gus] You're crazy, I'm not...

728
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,842
...a scared old fool
who needs heavy therapy.

729
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:17,191
Just tell him you're sorry.

730
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,975
[Gus] I shot him
with a tranquilizer.

731
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:20,847
[woman] I don't care
what you did.
[Gus] I pushed him...

732
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,414
.[woman] Now you're making me
upset this little nugget.
-[panting]

733
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,330
This perfect noodle...
[mumbling]

734
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:27,332
[Gus] Listen, let's get
the hell out of here.

735
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,508
[woman] 'Cause I wanna look
at your little, little paw.

736
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:31,118
You're so good.

737
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:32,424
So good.

738
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:33,860
-So good.
-[Lulu grunts softly]

739
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:35,035
[woman] What a little nugget.

740
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:39,605
-[woman] Honey...
-Look, Jesus, I...

741
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:40,606
[Briggs] Shut up.

742
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,303
Sit down.

743
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:47,308
Uh...

744
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,140
How'd you make her
eat out of your hand?

745
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:54,881
[Lulu whining]

746
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:58,319
I didn't make her
do anything.

747
00:37:58,363 --> 00:37:59,102
I just talked to her.

748
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:02,280
By the way, you can do
anything you like

749
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:03,672
with my idiot husband.

750
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:06,719
Gus, apologize.

751
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:10,679
[hesitates] Sorry, dude.
My bad, my bad.

752
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:19,949
[Lulu whining and panting]

753
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:21,777
[woman] Hmm, see,
she's just a noodle.

754
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:23,431
She just needs some good...

755
00:38:23,475 --> 00:38:25,346
I'm just going to touch her
little, little paw.

756
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,348
Is she gonna be okay?

757
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:29,568
Well, I'm worried she may
have broken her foot,

758
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:31,961
but I'm gonna try my best.

759
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:34,094
You need to give, um...
What is her name?

760
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:35,138
Lulu.

761
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:36,662
Lulu and I some space.

762
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:38,403
So, um, here.

763
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:40,579
Come on.
Gus, make yourself useful

764
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:42,494
and get this man
some clean clothes

765
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,757
because he's really
smelling strongly

766
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,367
of Boris and his friends.

767
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,587
So here, take some
homemade edibles.

768
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,806
Go make friends, okay?

769
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:55,768
Guys, come on, stop it.
Get outside.

770
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:57,117
[Gus] You can't tell me that

771
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,988
you did this
with a damn shoestring.

772
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:00,207
[Briggs] You just gotta
compromise the plastic.

773
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,513
That's it. [chuckles]

774
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:04,211
Listen, I'm a lot better
at permaculture

775
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:05,386
than I am tying dudes up.

776
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:09,564
I need to know, man,
how close was I to...

777
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:11,784
-Dying?
-Yeah.

778
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:14,003
Pretty...
Pretty close, actually.
I almost put an axe
in the back of your head.

779
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:15,527
[sighs]

780
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,877
[hesitates] This is...
Well done.

781
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,400
-Yeah, right? Right?
-Hmm.

782
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:22,011
I'm just glad
you love that dog so much.

783
00:39:22,055 --> 00:39:24,231
I don't love that dog.
It's not even my dog.

784
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:25,841
Come on, get on your back.

785
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:27,190
Get on your back,
you can do it.

786
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:28,801
-Come on.
-[Gus] Whose damn dog

787
00:39:28,844 --> 00:39:29,584
-Is it?
-[zip tie snaps]

788
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:33,371
[both cheering]

789
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:34,546
[Briggs] Look, you see that?

790
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:37,375
-You see this?
-[Gus] Yeah.

791
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,072
[Briggs] This is how they teach
them to attract the enemy.
They can smell their clothes
from, like, a mile off.

792
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:42,815
Is this two dead dudes?

793
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:44,294
[Briggs laughs]

794
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:45,861
Yeah. Those are...
That's two Taliban,

795
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:48,081
uh, dope farmers right there.

796
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:49,648
Oh, don't look
all shocked, man.

797
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,258
It's war.
It's not all unicorns

798
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:53,042
and rainbow vaginas
out there, right?

799
00:39:53,695 --> 00:39:56,002
Yeah, I bet.

800
00:39:56,045 --> 00:40:00,136
So why do they call it
I Love Me book?

801
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,921
I don't know.
Uh, but in the army,

802
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:03,662
they just,
they make us all keep one.

803
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:06,229
They make us put every single,
last stupid detail in.

804
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:11,670
So, Lulu's greatest hits.
This is like...

805
00:40:11,713 --> 00:40:13,585
Like her music.
Like, music she...

806
00:40:13,628 --> 00:40:16,370
No, no, no, no, no.
It's the other greatest hits,

807
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,067
you know.

808
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:20,200
[chuckles] Like,
it's her bodycam footage.

809
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:21,680
-Oh, Jesus.
-Yeah.

810
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:22,550
It's the...
[imitates gunshots] kinda...

811
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:24,465
Yeah, I'll pass.

812
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:25,858
So let me get this right, man.

813
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:28,687
So, like, the dog
did all this, man.

814
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,036
I mean, they're just
going to put her down?

815
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:34,867
Look, don't get all
misty-eyed on me, big man.

816
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,869
Like, it's...
It's not like that.

817
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:40,176
That dog did exactly
what she was born to do,

818
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,657
and that was to live
a legendary life.

819
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:44,311
And she did it.

820
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:48,707
What the hell is this here?

821
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:51,144
"Dear Lulu,

822
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:53,363
I can hardly imagine life
before I knew you.

823
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:56,497
Did you come into this world
a beast of fury,

824
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:58,630
-or were you just..."
-What was that? What was that?

825
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:00,632
He wrote... It's like written
up on top right there.

826
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:02,503
There's a couple of 'em,

827
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:04,940
like poems or love letters,
or something.

828
00:41:04,984 --> 00:41:08,466
Rodriguez could barely spell.

829
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:11,120
I mean, he definitely
can't rhyme.

830
00:41:11,164 --> 00:41:13,035
I know what this is.
This is...

831
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,515
So when you have
a brain injury,

832
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,126
you basically get sent
to these brain doctors.

833
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,390
And then they study you,
and they make you draw

834
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:22,654
and write and do
all this art therapy bullshit.

835
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:24,525
Nobody really
takes it serious.

836
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:25,570
-Shit!
-Oh!

837
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:26,875
-[woman laughs]
-Dog!

838
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:28,529
-You're okay. Hey.
-[Lulu barking]

839
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:30,226
Look at her.
She's running around.

840
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,533
Yeah. There was just
a little piece of barbed wire

841
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,361
just lodged way up in her paw.

842
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:36,319
I sterilized it
and stopped the bleeding.

843
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:37,930
Never seen a dog so strong.

844
00:41:37,973 --> 00:41:39,975
Thank you. Thank you so much.

845
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:42,500
Also, she did offer me
a transmission.

846
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:45,154
-If you feel called.
-Transmission?

847
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:47,722
Yeah, she bats
about 350 on those.

848
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:49,463
I mean, but, you know,

849
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,161
if it was baseball,

[laughing]

1026
00:49:17,084 --> 00:49:20,000
Hey, dog, you should
see this guy's face.

1027
00:49:20,044 --> 00:49:22,133
[laughs] Hey! No!

1028
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:23,656
Get off! Get off there!

1029
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:25,005
Don't do it! Stop!

1030
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:27,007
No! No! You...

1031
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:29,705
Okay. You know what?
I didn't even care anyways.

1032
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:30,837
That was your bed.
'Cause I'm going out.

1033
00:49:31,272 --> 00:49:33,492
[whining]

1034
00:49:34,536 --> 00:49:36,974
[TV playing indistinctly]

1035
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:48,072
Do I look like 200k a year
or what?

1036
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:51,249
Look at you, sitting on
the couch, looking all cute.

1037
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:53,555
Why didn't you tell me
all I had to do was just

1038
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,384
turn on the TV and put your
greatest hits on of you mauling
people, to get you to relax?

1039
00:49:57,342 --> 00:49:59,039
[chuckles] You narcissist.

1040
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:01,520
What happened, no go
on the Indian food?

1041
00:50:01,563 --> 00:50:02,564
I told you,
you can't trust psychics.

1042
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,306
But don't you worry.

1043
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,439
I got exactly what you want.

1044
00:50:07,482 --> 00:50:11,008
Dry-aged, marbled-on-the-bone
beautifulness. Ready?

1045
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:14,620
Take it, savor it. Come on.

1046
00:50:16,448 --> 00:50:18,232
You don't have to be scared.
Just take it out of my hand.

1047
00:50:20,191 --> 00:50:21,192
Whatever.

1048
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:28,634
Do not do anything stupid.

1049

[growling softly]

1050
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:39,906

-[whining]
-Hell, no.

1052
00:50:41,777 --> 00:50:43,257
Oh, you think you're
coming with me?

1053
00:50:43,301 --> 00:50:44,737
Do you think I forgot
about Portland?

1054
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,347
-[barks]
-No.

1055
00:50:46,391 --> 00:50:47,522
I'll never forget
about Portland.

1056
00:50:47,566 --> 00:50:49,263
-Ever.
-[barking]

1057
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:50,656
Go lay back down.

[barking]

1059
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:53,354
You asked for the bed,

1060
00:50:53,398 --> 00:50:54,660
I got you the bed.
Go lay down.

[Lulu sniffing]

1069
00:51:42,229 --> 00:51:44,405
You smell that, girl? Money.

1070
00:51:45,928 --> 00:51:47,626
Congratulations, by the way.

-[Briggs] I'm... You okay?
-Yes, Mr. Briggs.

1076
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:05,600
-Of course, yeah.
-Wait, I know that voice.

1077
00:52:05,644 --> 00:52:08,386
-Wait. Who's that?
-Oh, we met at the front desk.

-[Briggs] Oh, the... Yes.
-Callan.

1079
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:11,519
[Briggs] Yes, Callan,
the front desk angel.

1080
00:52:11,563 --> 00:52:13,130
I'm looking for a place
to eat tonight.

1081
00:52:13,173 --> 00:52:14,783
-Oh, there are...
-Any good recommendations?

1082
00:52:14,827 --> 00:52:16,437
[Callan] Yes, there's
a fantastic oyster bar

1083
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:17,351
down at the Embarcadero.

1084
00:52:17,395 --> 00:52:18,918
[Briggs] I love oysters.

1085
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:20,311
They really, you know,
heighten the senses.

1086
00:52:20,354 --> 00:52:21,442
-What time do you get off?
-[Lulu growling softly]

1087

[Callan] You all right?
Take it easy, take it easy.

1105
00:53:03,745 --> 00:53:05,791
Okay. Here we go, here we go.

1106

Oh, my God, I can...
I can see.

1107
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,105
I can see. Guys, I can see!

[indistinct chatter]

1109
00:53:20,632 --> 00:53:24,244
Hey, hey! Hey!

1110
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:27,073
[officer] So you were
impersonating a blind man

1111
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:30,032
as part of a seeing eye
dog training exercise?

1112
00:53:30,076 --> 00:53:31,947
-[Briggs] Yep, that's right.
-Mmm-hmm.

1113
00:53:31,991 --> 00:53:35,473
When suddenly, uh,
unbeknownst to you,

1114
00:53:35,516 --> 00:53:38,127
um, your dog broke free
from your grasp,

1115
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:39,999
sprinted the entire length
of the lobby

1116
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:42,262
-and muzzle struck the victim?
-Correct.

1117
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:43,872
[officer] And you've never
seen this dog exhibit

1118
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:45,657
any type of aggressive
behavior before this?

1119
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,616
Never. Never. She usually...
She loves people.

1120
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,097
It's out of her character.
I really don't understand it.

1121
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,925
-Man, honestly, I'm in shock.
-[clicks tongue] Uh-huh.

1122
00:53:55,014 --> 00:53:56,320
Is there anything else
you want to add?

1123
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:57,625
How is the guy?
Is he all right?

1124
00:53:57,669 --> 00:53:59,061
-Yeah.
-He seemed okay.

1125
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:00,324
Well, we're gonna
be contacting

1126
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:02,935
Dr. Al-Farid in the morning.

1127
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:05,285
He wants to press charges.
We'll take it from there.

1128
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:08,157
Until then,
you just sit tight.

1129
00:54:08,201 --> 00:54:10,072
[Briggs] Cool, and the dog?
Dog's okay?

1130
00:54:10,116 --> 00:54:11,378
[officer] We're gonna
have to check

1131
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:12,901
with animal control
on that one.

1132
00:54:12,945 --> 00:54:14,294
[Briggs] Okay.
So when do I get her back?

1133
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:16,165
Do I have to post bail
or whatever?

1134
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:18,951
[officer] Post bail?
Buddy, it is Friday night.

1135
00:54:18,994 --> 00:54:21,432
Judge is not back
until Monday A.M.

1136
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:25,131
And I am required
to keep all suspects

1137
00:54:25,174 --> 00:54:26,872
in possible hate crimes
in my custody.

1138
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:28,526
Hate crime?

1139
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:30,267
Now, don't start with me.
Take it to City Hall.

1140
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,964
Who said anything about a hate
crime? Wait, wait, wait.

1141
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:33,792
Hold on a second. Okay.
All right. Let me... Let me...

1142
00:54:33,835 --> 00:54:34,793
Let me level with you, man.

1143
00:54:36,098 --> 00:54:37,491
Okay? I was an Army Ranger.

1144
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,929
That dog's handler was
my buddy, and he passed.

1145
00:54:40,973 --> 00:54:43,932
I got to take her down to his
funeral in Arizona on Sunday.

1146
00:54:43,976 --> 00:54:46,500
I got a Gold Star family
that's just depending on me

1147
00:54:46,544 --> 00:54:47,893
to get her there.

1148
00:54:47,936 --> 00:54:49,329
All right?
Now I'll be back here

1149
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:50,896
first thing Monday morning.
I promise.

1150
00:54:50,939 --> 00:54:52,332
I just... I got to...
I got to get her

1151
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:53,333
and I got to go tonight.

1152
00:54:55,988 --> 00:54:57,163
You were an Army Ranger?

1153
00:54:57,206 --> 00:54:58,904
-[Briggs] Yeah.
-[chuckles]

1154
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:02,211
Why the hell
didn't you say so?

1155
00:55:03,691 --> 00:55:05,258
-I'm sorry.
-Instead of puttin' me through

1156
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,391
20 minutes of that Ray Charles
bullshit, huh?

1157
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:09,218
I was in the 202nd.

1158
00:55:09,262 --> 00:55:10,350
Hey, buddy,
I gotta tell you something.

1159
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:11,830
And I gotta level with you.

1160
00:55:11,873 --> 00:55:13,397
You going into that
hotel lobby, huh,

1161
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,399
with that damn cane
and those glasses, man.

1162
00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:16,574
You Army Rangers,

1163
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:18,271
you've got balls of steel.

1164
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,881
-No. It was stupid.
-I'm a huge fan, seriously.

1165
00:55:19,925 --> 00:55:21,143
Hey, I gotta ask
you something,
on the real, on the real.

1166
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:24,756
You sent that little beast
for that raghead, didn't ya?

1167
00:55:25,496 --> 00:55:27,019
-What?
-Huh?

1168
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:28,890
Get a little payback for what
they took from us, right?

1169
00:55:28,934 --> 00:55:30,501
-Right?
-No. I... No,

1170
00:55:30,544 --> 00:55:32,372
-definitely, I didn't do that.
-Come on. Don't worry, man.

1171
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,200
My lips are sealed.
I'm not gonna say nothing.

1172
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:36,376
And us 31 Alphas,
we keep it tight.

1173
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,073
-You know?
-Alpha 31s?

1174
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:39,510
Yeah, we looked out for you
badasses real good.

1175
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:41,990
Out by the front gate, right?

1176
00:55:42,817 --> 00:55:44,036
Oh, you were an MP.

1177
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,385
-Damn right.
-Right.

1178
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:46,865
What are you implying?

1179
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:48,954
Oh, no, no,
I'm not implying anything.

1180
00:55:49,563 --> 00:55:51,783
No, I mean, we...

1181
00:55:51,826 --> 00:55:55,264
You MPs, man,
you guys got a hard job.

1182
00:55:55,308 --> 00:55:57,092
I never slept better
knowing that you guys

1183
00:55:57,136 --> 00:55:58,746
were out there
at the guardhouse,

1184
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,400
on the wall, watching over us.

1185
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:02,402
Yeah, I appreciate
that, brother.

1186
00:56:02,446 --> 00:56:04,012
Yeah, I appreciate it too
that you're not like

1187
00:56:04,056 --> 00:56:06,145
all those other Army Rangers
that I've met.

1188
00:56:06,188 --> 00:56:07,668
You know, with the long beards

1189
00:56:07,712 --> 00:56:09,844
flowing in the wind,
like they were Moses?

1190
00:56:09,888 --> 00:56:13,674
The car going right by the
front gate, not showin' an ID,

1191
00:56:13,718 --> 00:56:16,155
flipping us off,
"Thank you for your service."

1192
00:56:16,198 --> 00:56:17,417
Yeah, you're not one
of those guys, are you?

1193
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:18,853
-No, I...
-No, no, no.

1194
00:56:18,897 --> 00:56:20,333
-No, I definitely...
-You know what?

1195
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,466
I buy that.
You know what else I buy?

1196
00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:27,296
White military guy sics
his dog on a Muslim doctor

1197
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,821
in the heart of
woke-ing class America.

1198
00:56:29,864 --> 00:56:31,431
[Briggs] Man, don't do this.

1199
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:33,651
Don't do this. Just let me
get my dog and go.

1200
00:56:33,694 --> 00:56:35,000
Oh, now it's your dog!

1201
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:38,264
Sleep tight, bitch.

1202
00:56:39,483 --> 00:56:40,614
[sighs]

1203
00:56:40,658 --> 00:56:41,659
[door closes]

1204
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:47,012
[man] Briggs?

1205
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:50,058
[knocking]

1206
00:56:50,102 --> 00:56:51,408
[man] Rise and shine.
Line-up time.

1207
00:56:56,804 --> 00:56:58,023
Step to the left.

1208
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:02,027
Really? A line-up?
It's like...

1209
00:57:02,854 --> 00:57:04,333
It's me, right?

1210
00:57:04,377 --> 00:57:06,248
[man] Everybody,
step to your right.

1211
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:08,599
What are we doing?
Did you guys even have dogs?

1212
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:11,819
He seems like a cat guy.

1213
00:57:11,863 --> 00:57:13,473
- Quiet, number three.
- [over speakers]
We all know it was me, right?

1214
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:14,213
Yes, it was him.

1215
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,041
Face forward.

1216
00:57:16,737 --> 00:57:18,260
It's him.

1217
00:57:18,304 --> 00:57:19,958
I got it. Thank you, sir.

1218
00:57:20,001 --> 00:57:22,439
Can I... Can I just, like...
You know what?

1219
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:24,136
I'm just gonna confess.
How about that?

1220
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:26,007
Step back, number three.

1221
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:27,748
No, I'm sorry. Can I confess?
Is that, like, a thing?

1222
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:29,228
Man, I've got lunch.

1223
00:57:29,271 --> 00:57:30,751
It was my fault. I don't...

1224
00:57:30,795 --> 00:57:32,536
Look, my dog,

1225
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:35,103
she was just doing
what she was trained to do.

1226
00:57:35,147 --> 00:57:37,149
And unfortunately,
she was trained

1227
00:57:37,192 --> 00:57:40,108
to attack guys that look
like Dr. Al-Farid.

1228
00:57:40,152 --> 00:57:41,545
All right, that's enough,
number three.

1229
00:57:41,588 --> 00:57:43,242
Wait, let him speak.

1230
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:44,678
There. But I'm sorry,
that is the truth.

1231
00:57:44,722 --> 00:57:46,375
She served seven years,
eight deployments,

1232
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:49,117
but she did save more people
than you can count.

1233
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:51,076
I'm not some racist
piece of shit,

1234
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,730
but I'll confess to whatever
it is that you want me to

1235
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:54,383
or do whatever you want me to,

1236
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:56,516
as long as someone promises me

1237
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,084
that they will get her
to that funeral this Sunday.

1238
00:57:59,127 --> 00:58:00,912
Is that a deal
that I can make?

1239
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:04,742
[scoffs] Give me a break.

1240
00:58:04,785 --> 00:58:06,439
All right.
Take him out of here.

1241
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,267
-Really? Nothing.
-[man] Next group in five.

1242
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:10,008
That's it?

1243
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:11,270
[man] Hold on, number three.

1244
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:19,887
So you impersonated
a blind man

1245
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:21,323
just to get a free hotel room?

1246
00:58:23,151 --> 00:58:24,849
Uh, yeah, yeah, I did.

1247
00:58:24,892 --> 00:58:27,199
Um, there was a psychic

1248
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:28,635
and she said that
she wanted...

1249
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:30,550
My dog wanted a mat...
Like, a comfy mattress.

1250
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:31,899
And some... Never mind.

1251
00:58:31,943 --> 00:58:33,118
It's... It's insane.

1252
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:36,730
It is insane.

1253
00:58:37,644 --> 00:58:38,993
And if you want my

1254
00:58:39,037 --> 00:58:40,125
non-clinical opinion,
so are you.

1255
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,128
Yeah, that's... That's fair.

1256
00:58:45,086 --> 00:58:48,350
But the more I sit with it,
it's even more insane to

1257
00:58:48,394 --> 00:58:51,310
leave my practice
and fly back from Boston

1258
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:53,312
just to prosecute a veteran

1259
00:58:53,355 --> 00:58:54,835
trying to get his dog
to a funeral.

1260
00:58:57,751 --> 00:58:59,448
Just promise,
when it's all done,

1261
00:58:59,492 --> 00:59:00,972
you'll seek professional help.

1262
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:04,541
I, uh... Yes, sir.

1263
00:59:06,194 --> 00:59:08,240
-Salaam.
-Salaam.

-[Briggs] Hey, what's up, dog?
-[Lulu whining]

1268
00:59:22,123 --> 00:59:25,213
What's up? How're you doing?

1269
00:59:25,257 --> 00:59:27,389
Never thought I'd be
this excited to see you.

1270
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:29,174
Has she always panted so much?

1271
00:59:29,217 --> 00:59:31,611
Yeah, she runs... She runs
hot, I guess, like me.

1272
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:33,352
She's not hot.

1273
00:59:33,395 --> 00:59:35,963
That's anxiety.
It comes from trauma.

1274
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:37,312
You know,
she tried to bite my colleague

1275
00:59:37,356 --> 00:59:39,314
when he lightly
touched her on the ears.

1276
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:41,621
Either take responsibility for
her or find someone who will.

1277
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:44,232
Okay, thank you.

1278
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:51,849
You're ready
to get out of here? Huh?

1279
00:59:53,111 --> 00:59:55,461
Your personal effects.
Dismissed.

1280
00:59:56,854 --> 00:59:59,334
As in, get out of my face.

00:59:59,378 --> 01:00:01,859
Did you hear the nice man?
We should get out of his face.

1282

Come on.

You're a very photogenic dog,
you know that?

01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:34,979
You look like a hero.

1292
01:00:38,983 --> 01:00:40,724
Why didn't you tell me
you had a brother?

1293
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:42,247
And he lives in Los Angeles.

1294
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:43,683
We got something in common,
me and you.

You know what?
I'll make you a deal.

You don't do anything
all psychotic on this trip,

1298
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:55,303
and we make good time,
we can go see him.

1299
01:00:56,609 --> 01:00:59,960

you have full permission

come on, let's go.

1358
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:56,327
[Noah] Stay calm.
You're having fun.

1359
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:58,111
-This is fun.
-[barking]

1360
01:04:58,155 --> 01:04:59,504
Oh, having fun?
Just look at her.

1361
01:04:59,547 --> 01:05:00,897
She wants to murder me.

1362
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,202
[Noah] Relax.
[Briggs] This isn't fun.

1363
01:05:02,246 --> 01:05:03,725
-Relax.
-[Briggs] Come on, come on.

1364
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:05,379
-Come on, we'll make it fun.
-[Lulu barking]

1365
01:05:05,423 --> 01:05:07,207
It's fun. Take a little piece.

1366
01:05:07,251 --> 01:05:08,600
Take a little piece.
I know you like it.

1367
01:05:08,643 --> 01:05:10,819
-I know you want it.
-[panting]

1368
01:05:10,863 --> 01:05:12,125
[barking]

1369
01:05:12,169 --> 01:05:13,953
Remind me again
why we want her to bite.

1370
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:16,956
She doesn't know what war is.
For her, it's just work.

1371
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,089
You've got to show her
that work can be fun again,

1372
01:05:19,132 --> 01:05:20,917
nothing bad
is going to happen, okay?

1373
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,527
That's how you make a bond.

1374
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,007
I don't need to make
a bond, okay?

1375
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,747
I just... What, am I not
fun enough for you?

1376
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:26,879
-You're fun.
-Come on.

1377
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,098
Just hold your arm up
a bit higher.

1378
01:05:28,141 --> 01:05:29,534
It's up, man. Take it.

1379
01:05:29,577 --> 01:05:30,970
-Come on, just get it.
-[Nuke barks]

1380
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:33,842
-Good boy, Nuke. Good boy!
-Good boy.

1381
01:05:33,886 --> 01:05:35,583
Let him know
this is love, your chew toy,

1382
01:05:35,627 --> 01:05:36,758
this is fun.

1383
01:05:36,802 --> 01:05:39,674
Good boy, Nuke. Good boy.

1384
01:05:39,718 --> 01:05:40,937
[Briggs] So you're
telling me that Nuke

1385
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,026
was just as messed up as Lulu.

1386
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:45,463
I'd been working every day
for six months

1387
01:05:45,506 --> 01:05:48,379
before I convinced the army
to let me adopt him out.

1388
01:05:48,422 --> 01:05:49,293
Thought we'd never get there.

1389
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,731
Now we trust Nuke to babysit.

1390
01:05:52,774 --> 01:05:54,037
Kids, burgers!

1391
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:54,863
Shit.

1392
01:06:00,391 --> 01:06:02,567
Daddy, was this on the ground?

1393
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:05,004
-No.
-You're lying. I saw it fall.

1394
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:07,267
Baby, I dropped it
into my hand, okay?

1395
01:06:07,311 --> 01:06:09,182
-It's fine. You're fine.
-[grunts in frustration]

1396
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:10,531
[grunts]

1397
01:06:10,575 --> 01:06:12,142
[music playing faintly]

1398
01:06:12,185 --> 01:06:12,838
Saturdays.

1399
01:06:15,623 --> 01:06:17,016
I can barely
take care of the dogs.

1400
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,278
I don't know
how you're doing all this.

1401
01:06:18,322 --> 01:06:20,150
Yeah, I get it.

1402
01:06:20,193 --> 01:06:21,629
Nuke was about
all I could handle,

1403
01:06:21,673 --> 01:06:23,805
but when he stopped
struggling,

1404
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:25,155
that's when I realized
maybe I could

1405
01:06:25,198 --> 01:06:26,591
stop struggling too, you know?

1406
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:31,596
[Briggs] Do you think Riley
could've fixed Lulu?

1407
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:34,425
[Noah] Not by keeping her
in the fight, no.

1408
01:06:34,468 --> 01:06:37,167
You gotta know when to hang
'em up or check out, I guess.

1409
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:41,301
Well, sometimes Rangers
just find a way to die, man.

1410
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:46,089
Give Riley's mom a big hug.

1411
01:06:46,132 --> 01:06:48,656
They didn't talk much, I know,
but she meant a lot to him.

1412
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,267
Yeah, I will, man.

1413
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:58,014
Oh, come on. No! Shit!
You gotta be kidding me.

1414
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:00,407
No, it's a real
nice neighborhood

1415
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:01,669
you got here, man.

1416
01:07:03,236 --> 01:07:05,630
They got all my shit.
They got Riley's shit.

1417
01:07:05,673 --> 01:07:07,284
They got my meds.

1418
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:08,937
Well, that's good.

1419
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:10,243
At least I can give
his parents his dog tags.

1420
01:07:10,287 --> 01:07:11,679
-[Lulu whining]
-[Briggs] Oh, good.

1421
01:07:11,723 --> 01:07:13,594
They left your unicorn.

1422
01:07:13,638 --> 01:07:16,032
-[Lulu barking]
-Lulu, Lulu, here.

1423
01:07:17,642 --> 01:07:19,078
Seek.

1424
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:20,166
[sniffing]

1425
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:21,559
[Briggs] Yeah, Lulu, go, seek.

1426
01:07:25,693 --> 01:07:27,043
-[Noah] Good boy.
-[Briggs] Lulu, seek.

1427
01:07:28,522 --> 01:07:29,915
[Noah] Seek, seek.

1428
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:34,006
What's in here?

1429
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,312
[Briggs] Oh, yeah. There we go.
There we go.

1430
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:37,488
Good boy, Nuke. Good boy.

1431
01:07:37,531 --> 01:07:39,490
Okay, okay. Come on, Nuke.

1432
01:07:39,533 --> 01:07:40,708
Come, Nuke. Nuke. Seek.

1433
01:07:42,014 --> 01:07:43,711
I guess we're going
in the right direction.

1434
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:44,669
Seek, seek.

1435
01:07:45,235 --> 01:07:46,410
Seek, seek.

1436
01:07:46,453 --> 01:07:48,281
[Noah] Yes, baby, yes.

1437
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:50,327
Put the water on,
I'm sure it's boiling.

1438
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,242
Yes, pesto is fine.

1439
01:07:52,285 --> 01:07:54,157
We're... I'm just showing
my buddy the Boardwalk.

1440
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,333
Sorry, Tiffany, I just
wanted to see the piers.

1441
01:07:56,376 --> 01:07:58,291
[Noah] Yes, okay.
We'll be back soon, okay?

1442
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,336
[Briggs] Seek.

1443
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:02,774
-Nuke!
-[woman] Oh, hey!

1444
01:08:02,817 --> 01:08:04,776
[panting]

1445
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:06,778
-[Lulu barking]
-Yeah, Lulu, go, go, seek.

1446
01:08:09,433 --> 01:08:11,130
[Noah] Seek, seek.

1447
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:13,132
Just don't let her go.
Seek, Nuke.

1448
01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:16,266
Seek.

1449
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:17,093
Seek, Nuke.

1450
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:25,362
Seek, seek, seek.

1451
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:28,495
Find it, Nuke. Find it.

1452
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:30,018
[indistinct chatter]

1453
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:34,110
-[man] Hey! Hey!
-[Briggs] Seek.

1454
01:08:34,153 --> 01:08:35,502
[man] Joe! Shut the hell up.

1455
01:08:35,546 --> 01:08:37,504
[sniffing]

1456
01:08:37,548 --> 01:08:40,899
[Briggs] Seek, seek.

1457
01:08:42,422 --> 01:08:43,728
Seek. Seek.

1458
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:47,427
Seek.

1459
01:08:47,471 --> 01:08:49,908
[Lulu sniffing]

1460
01:08:49,951 --> 01:08:51,823
-[Briggs] Seek.
-[Lulu whines]

1461
01:08:51,866 --> 01:08:52,954
-[barking]
-[Briggs] Yeah, yeah,

1462
01:08:52,998 --> 01:08:53,955
she found it, she found it.

1463
01:08:55,653 --> 01:08:56,741
[Noah] Good boy, Nuke.

1464
01:08:56,784 --> 01:08:58,395
[Briggs] Yeah, this is it.

1465
01:08:58,438 --> 01:09:01,789
Yeah, yeah, it's my shit.
It's just everywhere.

1466
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:02,921
This crackhead's
probably snorting

1467
01:09:02,964 --> 01:09:04,314
my migraine meds right now.

1468
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:07,317
[dogs barking]

1469
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,014
Yeah, most of
Riley's shit's here.

1470
01:09:09,057 --> 01:09:10,189
Her book's here.

1471
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:14,715
Hey, what is this shit, man?
This is private property.

1472
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:16,413
-Oh, is it? That's yours?
-Yeah.

1473
01:09:16,456 --> 01:09:18,328
-All right, Jackson, let's go.
-Your name's Rodriguez?

1474
01:09:18,371 --> 01:09:20,417
Man, I'm a United States
army veteran, man.

1475
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,201
Yeah? Take it off right now.

1476
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:23,681
-I ain't taking off shit.
-What battalion were you in?

1477
01:09:24,377 --> 01:09:25,726
That's classified.

1478
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,641
[groaning and screaming]

1479
01:09:27,685 --> 01:09:30,601
[Briggs] Get it off!
Get it off!

1480
01:09:30,644 --> 01:09:34,561
[thief continues screaming]
Oh, goddamn, man.

1481
01:09:34,605 --> 01:09:36,955
Hey, I serve my country,

1482
01:09:36,998 --> 01:09:38,565
and this is the thanks I get?

1483
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:39,871
I'm a war hero!

1484
01:09:39,914 --> 01:09:41,655
[man] Get the fuck
outta here, man!

1485
01:09:41,699 --> 01:09:43,266
[Noah] You're gonna be
all good without those meds?

1486
01:09:43,309 --> 01:09:44,702
[Briggs] I should have
just let her eat

1487
01:09:44,745 --> 01:09:46,573
that stolen valor
piece of shit.

1488
01:09:46,617 --> 01:09:48,793
[Noah] You never know in places
like that who served.

1489
01:09:49,924 --> 01:09:51,622
And if you were here
five years ago,

1490
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:53,493
you could have caught my ass
under that pier,

1491
01:09:53,537 --> 01:09:55,887
and that would have been
the best-case scenario.

1492
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:57,802
[Briggs] Yeah, but I didn't.

1493
01:09:57,845 --> 01:09:59,195
'Cause that bullshit ain't us.

1494
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:00,239
Yeah?

1495
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:01,240
What about Riley?

1496
01:10:02,154 --> 01:10:03,938
What about Riley?

1497
01:10:03,982 --> 01:10:06,071
I mean, the dude
couldn't get out of bed
without popping three percs.

1498
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:08,813
Well, that's just
the breakfast of champions,

1499
01:10:08,856 --> 01:10:10,597
and he was a champion.

1500
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:13,078
I can't tell you how many
times he called me up,

1501
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:14,732
we'd get shitfaced
talking about

1502
01:10:14,775 --> 01:10:16,429
how we were gonna check out.

1503
01:10:16,473 --> 01:10:18,910
Look, man, we all
deal with shit

1504
01:10:18,953 --> 01:10:20,738
to stay in the game, okay?

1505
01:10:20,781 --> 01:10:22,130
So we're supposed
to stay in it forever?

1506
01:10:23,393 --> 01:10:24,916
He used to talk
about driving off

1507
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:26,831
the Grand Canyon at top speed,

1508
01:10:26,874 --> 01:10:29,312
but he drove himself
into a tree instead.

1509
01:10:34,317 --> 01:10:35,753
I tried to get him to talk.

1510
01:10:36,928 --> 01:10:38,625
Talk, like what,
to a therapist?

1511
01:10:38,669 --> 01:10:40,236
That was a great idea.

1512
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:42,020
No, to other guys
who have gone through it,

1513
01:10:42,063 --> 01:10:43,064
or even just to God.

1514
01:10:43,891 --> 01:10:45,458
God?

1515
01:10:45,502 --> 01:10:47,678
Okay, you didn't know shit
about Riley, all right?

1516
01:10:47,721 --> 01:10:49,680
Look, by God, I mean anything.

1517
01:10:49,723 --> 01:10:51,159
Could be a rock,
could be a shoe,

1518
01:10:51,203 --> 01:10:53,118
could be his damn barber.

1519
01:10:53,161 --> 01:10:55,903
But we all got to pick
something at some point.

1520
01:10:56,556 --> 01:10:57,557
[Briggs] Well...

1521
01:10:59,864 --> 01:11:03,781
he didn't, and he won't.

1522
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:07,741
So ain't no use
bitching about it.

1523
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:09,482
[Noah] You know, we trained
to put the whole world

on our back.

1525
01:11:11,005 --> 01:11:12,659
At the end of the day,

1526
01:11:12,703 --> 01:11:14,139
the hardest thing was knocking
on a friend's door.

1527
01:11:16,968 --> 01:11:18,056
Bye, Lulu.

1528
01:11:18,099 --> 01:11:20,058
Say hi to your daddy for me.

[panting and whining]

1530
01:11:21,407 --> 01:11:23,366
I'll be praying for you guys.

1531
01:11:23,409 --> 01:11:24,889
[Briggs] We're gonna
be just fine.

1532
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:27,718
Come here.

1535
01:12:08,672 --> 01:12:10,064
I hope you're ready
for this tomorrow,

1536
01:12:10,108 --> 01:12:12,153
because you know
what they want, right?

1537
01:12:13,807 --> 01:12:18,638
They want the hero war dog
all sad and stoic,

1538
01:12:18,682 --> 01:12:21,206
just missing her
hero war daddy.

1539
01:12:23,774 --> 01:12:25,428
What they definitely
don't want...

1540
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:27,560
They definitely don't want you
trying to eat everybody

1541
01:12:27,604 --> 01:12:29,954
as soon as the color guard
starts firing their salute.

1542
01:12:32,652 --> 01:12:33,958
Now, they...
They don't know you.

1543
01:12:34,828 --> 01:12:36,395
That's for damn sure.

1544
01:12:38,223 --> 01:12:39,964
They don't know
what it takes to be a hero.

1545
01:12:41,661 --> 01:12:43,968
The things you've done
to be a hero dog.

1546
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:46,449
If they knew the truth,

1547
01:12:47,841 --> 01:12:51,541
it would scare the living shit
out of them.

1548
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:58,069
You know, when I got out,

1549
01:12:58,112 --> 01:13:00,201
your daddy gave me
this shitty piece of plywood

1550
01:13:00,245 --> 01:13:02,378
with the word "Thanks"
carved in it. [chuckles]

1551
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,034
It's like, what else
do you say to somebody

1552
01:13:07,078 --> 01:13:09,776
that you experience
what we experienced together?

1553
01:13:12,649 --> 01:13:13,650
You even listening to me?

1554
01:13:15,652 --> 01:13:17,567
Just talking to a dog.

No. No, no.

1558

No, no. Come on.

1559
01:13:28,229 --> 01:13:29,405
Don't you do this to me now.

1560
01:13:36,499 --> 01:13:37,456
No.

1561
01:13:39,676 --> 01:13:41,242
Ow. [grunts]

-Okay...
-[whines]

1564
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:50,208
Of course, there's no service.

1565
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:51,339
Why would we have service?

01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:23,241
Hey, hey, hey.

1568

Hello?

1569
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,468
Hey.

1570
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,005
Come on.

1571
01:14:51,356 --> 01:14:53,489
All right, we got to go.

01:14:53,532 --> 01:14:55,403
-Come on. We're moving on.

Hey, hey, no.

1575
01:14:58,885 --> 01:15:00,757
No. Chill out.

-[barking continues]
-Hey. Hey, hey!

1577
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:06,110
No! Stop! Relax!

1578
01:15:06,153 --> 01:15:08,547
Look, stop. It's just thunder.

1579
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:10,897
It's just a thunderstorm.
We gotta... Stop.

1580
01:15:11,768 --> 01:15:13,334
-Calm down. Stop!
-[growls]

1581

Hey!

1582
01:15:14,988 --> 01:15:16,990
All right, you want to go?
Come on. Come on, then.

1583
01:15:17,034 --> 01:15:18,949
Come on,
you're not gonna do shit.

1584
01:15:20,211 --> 01:15:21,429
Come on, then, let's go!

Such a coward.

[soft music playing]

1591
01:16:34,677 --> 01:16:37,244
Easy. I'm not gonna make you
go out there, okay?

1592
01:16:37,288 --> 01:16:39,246
How about we just chill out
for a little while?

1593
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:40,508
Relax.

Hey, it's okay.

1596
01:16:43,468 --> 01:16:44,991
It's just thunder
and a little lightning.

1597
01:16:46,689 --> 01:16:49,474
You know what? How about this?
Let me see if I can

1598
01:16:49,517 --> 01:16:52,129
give us a little something
to take our mind off.

1599
01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:54,479
Cross your paws.
Let's see if this thing works.

1600
01:16:54,522 --> 01:16:55,393
What do you feel like?

1601
01:16:57,047 --> 01:16:58,483
Who doesn't like
San Francisco?

1602
01:16:58,526 --> 01:17:00,050
You want to watch
your greatest hits,

1603
01:17:00,093 --> 01:17:01,486
or do you wanna watch...
Wanna watch Grey's?

1604
01:17:01,529 --> 01:17:02,705
I'm gonna go with Grey's.

1605
01:17:05,925 --> 01:17:07,535
[laughs] It works.

1606
01:17:11,539 --> 01:17:12,845
We're just gonna rest,

1607
01:17:12,889 --> 01:17:15,108
we're gonna get
a little cozy, relax.

[TV playing indistinctly]

1609
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,245
Watch a little trash TV.

1610
01:17:23,203 --> 01:17:25,684
A little snack 'cause
you can't watch trash TV

1611
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:26,511
without a snack.

1612

What?

1614

Oh, you want some?

1615
01:17:42,135 --> 01:17:43,920
[laughs] Look at that.

1616
01:17:45,835 --> 01:17:48,359
Who knew you just needed
to have a fight to get along?

1617
01:17:53,277 --> 01:17:54,495
Did Latin Shakespeare ever,

1618
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:56,280
like, read you
his love letters?

1619
01:17:58,978 --> 01:18:00,153
Some pretty good ones
in there.

1621
01:18:08,118 --> 01:18:09,206
What about...

1622
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:12,688
Okay. [chuckles]

1623

"I woke for an instant when
I saw you covered in dirt.

You've taken bullets before.

01:18:26,223 --> 01:18:27,485
This was the worst.

1626
01:18:30,009 --> 01:18:31,315
The guilt still haunts me.

1627
01:18:32,969 --> 01:18:34,971
I'm not going to lie,

1628
01:18:35,014 --> 01:18:37,451
but I know you did
what you did that night,

1629
01:18:37,495 --> 01:18:39,540
so none of your brothers
had to die."

we'd run out of time

it hit me, girl,

I was never your handler.

That you were actually mine.

Yeah.

All right, I'll tell him
to expect your call.

Hey, and, Captain, thank you
for making this call.

Oh, uh, one more thing.

Look, she's...
She's doing a lot better.

1735
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,056
I mean, she's a completely
different dog now.

1736
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,449
I don't know, maybe there's
someone on base

1737
01:25:50,493 --> 01:25:52,190
that one of us could talk to.

1738
01:25:52,234 --> 01:25:54,366
[Jones] Briggs, you know
that's not up to us.

1739

-Just get it done.
-[Briggs] Yeah.

[Jones] Good luck over there,
Briggs.

Shit, man. You Rangers
ever hear of callin'?

I've been out here cooking
my ass off for an hour.

It could be worse.

[Levitz] All right, man.
I hear she's a real killer,

1802
01:32:24,669 --> 01:32:25,975
so just make sure
you muzzle her up good, okay?

Hey, man,
she's been doing a lot better.

01:32:44,036 --> 01:32:48,301
So just make sure the vet techs,
you know, reevaluate her, give
her a chance.

you're gonna call
Captain Jones, yeah?
